# clearcode
Even clean code can function. But if code isn’t clear, it can bring a development organization to its knees.

## Principles for Better Design

Summary:
1. Incremental improvement - implement a small version that works in a basic use case, then extend. Don't build it all in once.
2. Reuse code. Don't reinvent the wheel
3. Five whys - get to the root cause of why something should be done by asking yourself why many times. Understand the problem well before acting.
4. Keep the solution as simple as possible. Minimalization.
5. Perfection can't be reached, so don't aim there. Be as good as necessary.
6. Postpone complexity and introduce it only when really needed.
